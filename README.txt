Neon House — multipage showcase
===============================

Files:
- index.html            (landing)
- slot-rush.html        (slot game, balanced)
- volts-vaults.html     (slot game, high volatility)
- baccarat.html         (table game)

How to deploy on GitHub Pages:
1) Create a repo and upload all files to the repo root.
2) Also upload your audio track as `Option A.mp4` (or update the path in index.html).
3) In Settings → Pages, set Source: main, Folder: /(root).

All pages share one credit balance via localStorage key `neon_house_credits_v1`.
There is no reset button. To reset manually, clear site data for your domain.
